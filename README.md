# Database Engine Implementation


This project is for W4111 Introduction to Databases taught by Donald Ferguson in Spring 2019.
The purpose of this project is to understand the query optimization and the implementation of indexes.

This project is composed of following two parts:

1. Implement indexes on top of CSV data in CSVDataTable implementations.
2. Query optimization:
  Add a JOIN function to the CSVDataTable and implement query optimizations.
  Use Access Paths based on index selection to optimize find_by_template() and join().
